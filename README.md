Helloo everyone, My name is Michael. I'm a 17-year-old male (he/they)  
and I mainly program Java. I like to watch anime, and code all day.
Basically, if I'm not coding, I'm watching anime or sleeping xD

[Java](https://java.com) is not the only language I know, I often use [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) to code some random applications
and known Windows exploits and test them on my personal PC (risky, i know ðŸ˜„). I also
**try** to work with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) as my [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

I'm currently working on [Takai World](https://github.com/takaiworld) essentially making an rpg and all that. Though, that will take awhile to even get a working version as I'm pretty lazy right now .-.

Anyways, my fav song is [this](https://youtu.be/IWo5PXXp5PA), and its a great song honestly :3
