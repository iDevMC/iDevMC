[21](https://en.pronouns.page/@mick), average person out there. <br>
i mostly code (java, csharp, typescript), play the electric bass guitar (my favourite <3), the electric guitar and writing silly little stories in my free time. i tend to always type in lowercase and that's pretty much my thing. <br>
i also have way too many projects for my own good. current ones are: nightlight, verdelune network, dev @ orangesmp, pasture, hivemind.ink, [mykel's projects](https://github.com/mykelsprojects) and more.
